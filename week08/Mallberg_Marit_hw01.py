# Lab Section: 10
# Sources, people worked with, help given to: I worked with Mac Wienzierl and used GPT to decipher 
# error codes. 
# I am very annoyed with this assignment, as the data could be modeled in a much better
# and easier way to access, but I understand the premiss of the task.

# Homework Question:
# 
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scores 
# in different subjects.
# 
# Student Data:
students = [
   {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
   {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
   {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
   {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
]

#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.

# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.

#Solution

averages={}

for student in students:
   name=student["name"]
   avgscore=sum(student["scores"].values()) / 3
   averages[name]=avgscore

   if avgscore > 80:
      print(f"{name} has a score average greater than 80%")
print(averages)
